## 📚 Lab Sessions (Day-wise)
Explore the detailed implementation and code snippets for each session via the links below:

### 📉 [Day 1: Simple Linear Regression](./Day_1/README.md)
*Focuses on implementing the regression model from scratch using mathematical cross-deviation.*

### 📉 [Day 2: Gradient Descent Optimization](./Day_2/README.md)
*Focuses on iterative weight optimization and feature normalization.*

### 📉 [Day 3: Regularization (Lasso & Ridge)](./Day_3/README.md)
*Implementation of L1 and L2 regularization for feature selection and overcoming overfitting.*

### 📉 [Day 4: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)](./Day_4/README.md)
*Manual implementation of the KNN classifier using Euclidean distance and majority voting.*
